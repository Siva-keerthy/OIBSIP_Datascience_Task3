# OIBSIP_Datascience_Task3

This is **Task 3** of my **AICTE – Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship**. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **predict the selling price of a used car** based on various features such as year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more.

#Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing details about used cars to predict their selling price. This task simulates a real-world business problem where accurate pricing plays a key role in both buyer and seller decisions.

#Objective

To develop a **regression model** that can estimate car prices based on input features using supervised machine learning.
#Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data preprocessing
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation
-       
#Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed outliers
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized feature distributions
   - Checked correlation between variables

3. **Model Building**
   - Used **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Trained and tested models using train-test split

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used metrics like **R² Score**, **MAE**, **MSE**

#Results

- Developed a reliable model to predict car prices
- Random Forest outperformed linear regression in accuracy
- Demonstrated the importance of **feature selection** and **data cleaning** in regression tasks

# Key Learnings

This task helped me understand:
- The **end-to-end machine learning workflow** for regression problems
- How to prepare data and evaluate model performance
- How ML can be applied in **real-world business use cases**
